Calculator which supports the basic operations on integers. It works with English words for numbers and operators.

In case of errors it should emit "ERROR" as the calculation result. If any intermediate result is outside the range of valid numbers this is also considered an error.

Valid Operators: +, plus -, minus *, times /, divided by

Numbers all integers in the range -9.999.999 to 9.999.999 (inclusive)
